# React project to test calling YouTube API

<p>Keep in mind this project is making use of a local environment variable for my YouTube apikey.</p>
<p>Storing it in this manner can include the apikey into the build.  YouTube does allow you to lockdown your apikeys so that they can only be called from specific URLs, etc.</p>
